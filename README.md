# SoleJunkie

## About This Store

**SoleJunkie** is a fictional e-commerce project built as a learning exercise. It simulates a basic online storefront and shopping cart experience, covering core concepts in front-end web development.

> **Note:** This is not a real store — no products are for sale, and no orders will be processed. It's strictly for learning and demonstration purposes.
